CountUp - A Collaborative Tallying App

CountUp is a collaborative tallying app that allows users to create tallies (or counts) for various purposes. It functions like a digital tally counter or a scoreboard, where users can track and record activities or events. What makes CountUp unique is that tallies are officially recorded only when a minimum of three different users contribute to them, promoting a sense of community and shared interest tracking.

Features:

Create Tally: Users can create a new tally for any activity or event they want to track. Give your tally a name, description, and set the initial count.
Add Count: Once a tally is created, other users can contribute by adding counts to it. Each user can only add one count to a tally.
Leaderboard: The app provides an overview of all tallies and ranks them based on the total counts. Users can see who has the most counts and what those counts represent.
Collaborative Counting: To ensure accuracy and collaboration, tallies become official only when three different users have added counts to them.
